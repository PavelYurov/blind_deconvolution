## This Projects represents an implementation of a Total Variation Deconvoltuion Algorithm. 
### Two Approaches were followed:
  1. The original approach '"Total Variation Blind Deconvolution"' using Conjugate Gradient by Tony F. Chan and Chiu-Kwong Wong where they used Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient in order to solve the linear systems of h(kernel) and u(image).
  2. The second approach  is defined by a similar method described in "Total Variation Blind Deconvolution: The Devil Is in the Details" by Daniele Perrone and Paolo Favaro, where a gradient descent approach is used to optimize the 2 terms.
